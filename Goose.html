How short, how sweet those younger hours,

JILTED JACK

<p>
A noble and a generous mind
</p>
<p class="i4">
      Was Jack's;
</p>
<p>
Folks knew he would not talk behind
</p>
<p class="i4">
      Their backs:
</p>
<p class="i2">
  But when some maiden fresh and young,
</p>
<p class="i2">
  At Jack a bit of banter flung,
</p>
<p class="i2">
  She soon discovered that his tongue
</p>
<p class="i4">
      Was sharp as any ax.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
A flirt of most engaging wiles
</p>
<p class="i4">
      Was Jill;

<p>
On Jack she lavished all her smiles,

<p class="i4">
      Until

  Her slave (and he was not the first)

<p class="i2">
  Of lovesick swains became the worst,

<p class="i2">
  His glance a strong box might have burst,
</p>
<p class="i4">
      His sighs were fit to kill.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
One April morning, clear and fair,
</p>
<p class="i4">
      When both
</p>
<p>
Of staying home and idling there
</p>
<p class="i4">
      In sloth
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Were weary, Jack remarked to Jill:
</p>
<p class="i2">
  "Oh, what's the sense in sitting still?
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Let's mount the slope of yonder hill."
</p>
<p class="i4">
      And she was nothing loth.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
But as she answered: "What's the use?"
</p>
<p class="i4">
      The gruff
</p>
<p>
Young swain replied: "Oh, there's excuse
</p>
<p class="i4">
      Enough.
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Your doting parents water lack;
</p>
<p class="i2">
  We'll fill a pail and bring it back."
</p>
<p class="i2">
  (The reader will perceive that Jack

<p class="i4">

<p>
Thus hand in hand the tempting hill

      They scaled,

<p>
And Jack proposed a kiss to Jill,

<p class="i4">
      And failed!
</p>
<p class="i2">
  One backward start, one step too bold,
</p>
<p class="i2">
  And down the hill the couple rolled,
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Resembling, if the truth were told,
</p>
<p class="i4">
      A luggage train derailed.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
With eyes ablaze with anger, she

<p class="i2">
  You quite forget yourself, it's plain,

<p class="i4">
      (Her German might be blamed.)

<p>
But Jack, whose linguist's pride was pricked,

      To shine,

<h2>
THE BLATANT BRUTALITY
<br />
<span class="s05">OF</span>
<br />
LITTLE BOW PEEP
</h2>

<hr class="l15" />

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
Though she was only a shepherdess,
</p>
<p class="i1">
    Tending the meekest of sheep,
</p>
<p>
Never was African leopardess
</p>
<p class="i1">
    Crosser than Little Bow Peep:
</p>
<p>
Quite apathetic, impassible
</p>
<p class="i1">
    People described her as: "That
</p>
<p>
Wayward, contentious, irascible,
</p>
<p class="i1">
    Testy, cantankerous brat!"
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Yet, as she dozed in a grotto-like
</p>
<p class="i1">
    Sort of a kind of a nook,
</p>
<p>
She was so charmingly Watteau-like,
</p>
<p class="i1">
    What with her sheep and her crook;
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>10</a></span>
</p>
<p>
"She is a dryad or nymph," any
</p>
<p class="i1">
    Casual passer would think.
</p>
<p>
Poets pronounced her a symphony,
</p>
<p class="i1">
    All in the palest of pink.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Thus it was not enigmatical,
</p>
<p class="i1">
    That the young shepherd who first
</p>
<p>
Found her asleep, in ecstatical
</p>
<p class="i1">
    Sighs of felicity burst:
</p>
<p>
Such was his sudden beatitude
</p>
<p class="i1">
    That, as he gazed at her so,
</p>
<p>
Daphnis gave vent to this platitude:
</p>
<p class="i1">
    "My! Ain't she elegant though!"
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Roused from some dream of Arcadia,
</p>
<p class="i1">
    Little Bow Peep with a start
</p>
<p>
Answered him: "I ain't afraid o' yer!
</p>
<p class="i1">

She certainly ought to be collared and cuffed.

THE DISCOURAGING DISCOVERY

<br />
<span class="s05">
OF
</span>
<br />

LITTLE JACK HORNER

</h2>
<hr class="l15">


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
A knack almost incredible for dealing with an edible
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Jack Homer's elder sister was acknowledged to display;
</p>
<p>
She labored hard and zealously, but always guarded jealously
</p>
<p class="i2">
The secrets of the dishes she invented every day.
</p>
<p>
She'd take some indigestible, unpopular comestible,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And to its better nature would so tenderly appeal
</p>
<p>
That Jack invoked a benison upon a haunch of venison,
</p>
<p class="i2">
When ready she was serving him a little leg of veal!
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22'>22</a></span>
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Jack said she was a miracle. The word was not satirical,
</p>
<p class="i2">
For daily climbing upward, she excelled herself at last:
</p>
<p>
The acme of facility, the zenith of ability
</p>
<p class="i2">
Was what she gave her brother for his Christmas Day repast.
</p>
<p>
He dined that evening eagerly and anything but meagerly,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And when he'd had his salad and his quart of Extra Dry,
</p>
<p>
With sisterly benignity, and just a touch of dignity,
</p>
<p class="i2">
She placed upon the table an unutterable pie!
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Unflagging pertinacity, and technical sagacity,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Long nights of sleepless vigil, and long days of constant care
</p>
<p>
Had been involved in making it, improving it, and baking it,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Until of other pies it was the wonder and despair:
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23'>23</a></span>
</p>
<p>
So princely and so prominent, so solemn, so predominant
</p>
<p class="i2">
It looked upon the table, that, with fascinated eye,
</p>
<p>
The youth, with sudden wonder struck, electrified, and thunder struck,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Could only stammer stupidly: "Oh Golly! What a pie!"
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
In view of his satiety, it almost seemed impiety
</p>
<p class="i2">
To carve this crowning triumph of a culinary life,
</p>
<p>
But, braced by his avidity, with sudden intrepidity
</p>
<p class="i2">
He broke its dome imposing with a common kitchen knife.
</p>
<p>
Ah, hideous fatality! for when with eager palate he
</p>
<p class="i2">
Commenced to eat, he happened on an accident uncouth,
</p>
<p>
And cried with stifled moan: "Of it one plum I tried. The stone of it
</p>
<p class="i2">
Had never been extracted, and I've broke a wisdom tooth!"
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24'>24</a></span>
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Jack's sister wept effusively, but loudly and abusively
</p>
<p class="i2">
His unreserved opinion of her talents he proclaimed;
</p>
<p>
He called her names like "driveller" and "simpleton" and "sniveller,"
</p>
<p class="i2">
And others, which to mention I am really too ashamed.

A stone to strike in what you thought was paste. One thing alone

</p>
<p class="i2">
To strike but paste in what he fondly thought to be a stone.

(Which never occurred to the rest of us)

And, as 'twas a June day, and just about noonday,

<p class="i2">
She wanted to eat&emdash;like the best of us:
</p>
<p>
Her diet was whey, and I hasten to say

<p class="i2">
It is wholesome and people grow fat on it.

The spot being lonely, the lady not only

Discovered the tuffet, but sat on it.

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28'>28</a></span>
</p>
<p>
When, glancing aside for a moment, she spied
</p>
<p class="i2">
A horrible sight that brought fear to her,
</p>
<p>
A hideous spider was sitting beside her
</p>
<p class="i2">
And most unavoidably near to her!

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Albeit unsightly, this creature politely

Said: "Madam, I earnestly vow to you,

<p>
I'm penitent that I did not bring my hat. I
</p>
<p class="i2">
Should otherwise certainly bow to you."
</p>
<p>
Though anxious to please, he was so ill at ease
</p>
<p class="i2">
That he lost all his sense of propriety,
</p>
<p>
And grew so inept that he clumsily stept
</p>
<p class="i2">
In her plate&emdash;which is barred in Society.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
This curious error completed her terror;
</p>
<p class="i2">
She shuddered, and growing much paler, not
</p>
<p>
Only left tuffet, but dealt him a buffet
</p>
<p class="i2">
Which doubled him up in a sailor-knot.
</p>
<p>
It should be explained that at this he was pained:
</p>
<p class="i2">
He cried: "I have vexed you, no doubt of it!
</p>
<p>
Your fist's like a truncheon." "You're still in my luncheon,"

Was all that she answered. "Get out of it!"

Monotonously talk,

He gave a fretful shout:

      So when he saw upon the road,
</p>
<p class="i04">
          Some fifty feet away,
</p>
<p class="i2">
      A pieman, Simple Simon strode
</p>

<p class="i2">
      What kinds?" as lordly as a prince.
</p>
<p class="i2">
      The pieman said: "I've pumpkin, quince,

<p class="i2">
      Blueberry, lemon, peach, and mince:"
</p>
<p class="i04">
          And, showing his array,

<p>
He added: "Won't you try one, sir? They're very nice to-day."
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">
      Now Simon's taste was most profuse,

<p class="i04">
          And so, by way of start,
</p>
<p class="i2">
      He ate two cakes, a Charlotte Russe,
</p>
<p class="i04">
          Six buns, the better part
</p>
<p class="i2">
      Of one big gingerbread, a pair

<p class="i2">
      Of lady-fingers, an eclair,

<p class="i2">
      And ten assorted pies, and there,

<p class="i04">
          His hand upon his heart,

<p>
He paused to choose between an apple dumpling and a tart.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">
      Observing that upon his tray

<p class="i04">
          His goods were growing few,

<p class="i2">
      The pieman cried: "I beg to say

      One does not meet in many a moon.

<p class="i2">
      Pray, won't you try this macaroon?"
</p>
<p class="i2">
      But soon suspicious, changed his tune,

<p class="i04">
          Continuing: "What is due

<p>
I beg respectfully to add's a dollar twenty-two."
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">

      Then Simple Simon put a curb

<p class="i2">
      And turning with an air superb
</p>
<p class="i04">
          He suddenly took flight,

<p class="i2">
      The trusting pieman shortly heard

      We've seen that Simon's sense of fun

A Paris butcher kept a shop

This Gallic butcher led a life

    He never drank alone:

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54'>54</a></span>

He simply sat outside his door

    To slumber he was prone.

<h2>
THE MYSTERIOUS MISAPPREHENSION

<br />
<span class="s05">
CONCERNING
</span>
<br />

A MAN IN OUR TOWN

</h2>
<hr class="l15">


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
There was a man in our town,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Half beggar, half rapscallion,
</p>
<p>
Who, just because his eyes were brown,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Was thought to be Italian:
</p>
<p>
And, though with much insistence
</p>
<p class="i2">
He said that people erred,
</p>
<p>
And bitterly to Italy
</p>
<p class="i2">
He frequently referred,
</p>
<p class="i1">
    The false report, as is the way
</p>
<p class="i1">
    Of false reports, had come to stay!
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
So every one who'd been to Rome
</p>
<p class="i2">
By aid of Cook's or Gaze's,
</p>
<p>
Would call upon him at his home
</p>
<p class="i2">
To flaunt Italian phrases.
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72'>72</a></span>
</p>
<p>
"<span lang="it_IT">Capite Questa lingua?</span>"
</p>
<p>
The inquiry would be:
</p>
<p>
"<span lang="it_IT">Pochissimo? Benissimo!</span>
</p>
<p>
<span lang="it_IT">Vi prego, ditemi,</span>
</p>
<p class="i2">
<span lang="it_IT">Siete voi contento qua,</span>
</p>
<p class="i2">
<span lang="it_IT">Lontano dall'Italia?</span>"
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
The victim, plunged in deep disgust,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Grew nervous, could not slumber;
</p>
<p>
Said he, "I'm called Italian, just
</p>
<p class="i2">
Because my eyes are umber,
</p>
<p>
And if this persecution
</p>
<p class="i2">
Is ever to be stopped,
</p>
<p>
Some stern and stoic, hard, heroic
</p>
<p class="i2">
Course I must adopt!"
</p>
<p class="i1">
    And so, to everyone's surprise,
</p>
<p class="i1">
    He calmly scratched out both his eyes!
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
The neighbors said: "So strange a thing
</p>
<p class="i2">
Might seem to be an omen.
</p>
<p>
We <i>thought</i> his wits were wandering,
</p>
<p class="i2">
But now we <i>know</i> they're Roman!"
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73'>73</a></span>
</p>
<p>
And so at him by legions,
</p>
<p class="i2">
By bevies, hosts, and herds,
</p>
<p>
Professors, purists, tramps, and tourists
</p>
<p class="i2">
Screamed Italian words.
</p>
<p class="i1">
    Perceiving all he'd done was vain,
</p>
<p class="i1">
    He scratched his eyesight in again.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
<span class="smcap">The moral</span>: If your neighbors say
</p>
<p class="i2">
You're one thing or another,
</p>
<p>
You'll find there isn't any way
</p>
<p class="i2">
Their prejudice to smother.
</p>
<p>
What matter if they think you
</p>
<p class="i2">
From Italy or Greece?
</p>
<p>
I beg you, treasure no displeasure:
</p>
<p class="i2">
Bow and hold your peace.
</p>
<p class="i1">
    Like Omar, underneath the bow
</p>
<p class="i1">
    You'll find there's paradise enow!

<h2>
THE PREPOSTEROUS PERFORMANCE

<span class="s05">
OF
</span>
<br />

AN OLD LADY OF BANBURY

</h2>
<hr class="l15">


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
Within a little attic a retiring, but erratic
</p>
<p class="i2">
Old lady (six-and-eighty, to be frank),
</p>
<p>
Made sauces out of cranberry for all the town of Banbury,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Depositing the proceeds in the bank.
</p>
<p>
Her tendency to thriftiness, her scorn of any shiftiness
</p>
<p class="i2">
Built a bustling business, and in course
</p>
<p>
Of time her secret yearnings were revealed, and all her earnings
</p>
<p class="i2">
She squandered in the purchase of a horse.

<p>
"I am not in a hurry for a waggonette or surrey,"

<p>
And spite of all premonishment, to everyone's astonishment,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The gay old lady did so&emdash;and astride!
</p>
<p>
Now this was most periculous, but, what was more ridiculous,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The horse she bought had pulled a car, and so,
</p>
<p>
The lazy steed to cheer up, she'd a bell upon her stirrup,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And rang it twice to make the creature go!
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
I blush the truth to utter, but it seems a pound of butter
</p>
<p class="i2">
And thirty eggs she had to sell. Of course,
</p>
<p>
In scorn of ways pedestrian, this fatuous equestrian
</p>
<p class="i2">
To market gaily started on the horse.
</p>
<p>
Becoming too importunate to hasten, the unfortunate
</p>
<p class="i2">
Old lady plied her charger with a birch.
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85'>85</a></span>
</p>
<p>
In view of all her cronies, this stupidest of ponies

Fell flat before the Presbyterian church!

<p>
If it should chance that one set a red Italian sunset

A Turner composition, and with clever intuition,

To cap the climax, pile upon them all

The aurora borealis, then veracity, not malice,

THE QUIXOTIC QUEST

THREE BLIND MICE

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
A maiden mouse of an arrogant mind

<p>
Had three little swains and all were blind.
</p>
<p>
The reason for this I do not know,

But I think it was love that made them so,
</p>
<p>
For without demur they bowed to her,
</p>
<p>
Though she treated them all with a high hauteur.
</p>
<p>
She ruled them, schooled them, frequently fooled them,
</p>
<p>
Snubbed, tormented, and ridiculed them:
</p>
<p>
Mice as a rule are much like men,
</p>
<p>
So they swallowed their pride and called again.

To morbid romance was much inclined.

But I think by novels her head was turned.

<p>
She said that the chap who dared to nap
</p>
<p>
One hour inside of the farmer's trap
</p>
<p>
Might gain her, reign her, wholly enchain her,
</p>
<p>
Woo her, win her, and thence retain her!

Hope ran high in each suitor's breast,

<p>
And all determined to stand the test.

But I know some girls who'd have done the same!

<p>
As thus they kept to their word, and slept,

<p>
The farmer's wife to the pantry stept:
</p>
<p>
She sought them, caught them, carefully brought them

Out to the light, and there she taught them

With impudent hails she cried: "What ails

She jeered so, sneered so, flouted and fleered so,

<p>
Bartholomew Benjamin Bunting
</p>
<p class="i2">
Had only three passions in life,
</p>
<p>
And one of the trio was hunting,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The others his babe and his wife:
</p>
<p>
And always, so rigid his habits,
</p>
<p class="i2">
He frolicked at home until two,
</p>
<p>
And then started hunting for rabbits,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And hunted till fall of the dew.

With baby would patiently play.

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102'>102</a></span>
</p>
<p>
When thus was her energy wasted
</p>
<p class="i2">
A patented food she'd dispense.
</p>
<p>
(She had bought it the day that they pasted
</p>
<p class="i2">
The posters all over her fence.)

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
But Bonaparte Buckingham Bunting,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The infant thus blindly adored,
</p>
<p>
Replied to her worship by grunting,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Which showed he was brutally bored.
</p>
<p>
'Twas little he cared for the troubles
</p>
<p class="i2">
Of life. Like a crab on the sands,
</p>
<p>
From his sweet little mouth he blew bubbles,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And threatened the air with his hands.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Bartholomew Benjamin Bunting

<p class="i2">
One night, as his wife let him in,
</p>
<p>
Produced as the fruit of his hunting

<p class="i2">
A cottontail's velvety skin,
</p>
<p>
Which, seeing young Bonaparte wriggle,
</p>
<p class="i2">
He gave him without a demur,
</p>
<p>
And the babe with an aqueous giggle
</p>
<p class="i2">
He swallowed the whole of the fur!

She screamed herself mottled maroon:
</p>
<p>
She felt of his vertebræ spinal,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Expecting he'd surely succumb,
</p>
<p>
And gave him one vigorous, final,

<p class="i2">
Hard prod in the pit of his tum.

At first but a trifle perplexed,

By a change in his manner of grunting

Soon showed he was terribly vexed.
</p>
<p>
He displayed not a sign of repentance
</p>
<p class="i2">
But spoke, in a dignified tone,

<p>
The only consecutive sentence

He uttered. 'Twas: "Lemme alone."

<h2>
THE TOUCHING TENDERNESS

<br />
<span class="s05">
OF
</span>
<br />

KING KARL THE FIRST

</h2>
<hr class="l15">


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
For hunger and thirst King Karl the First
</p>
<p class="i2">
Had a stoical, stern disdain:
</p>
<p>
The food that he ordered consistently bordered
</p>
<p class="i2">
On what is described as plain.
</p>
<p>
Much trouble his cook ambitiously took
</p>
<p class="i2">
To tickle his frugal taste,
</p>
<p>
But all of his savoury science and slavery
</p>
<p class="i2">
Ended in naught but waste.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Said the steward: "The thing to tempt the King
</p>
<p class="i2">
And charm his indifferent eye
</p>
<p>
No doubt is a tasty, delectable pasty.
</p>
<p class="i2">
Make him a blackbird pie!"
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108'>108</a></span>
</p>
<p>
The cook at these words baked twenty-four birds,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And set them before the King,
</p>
<p>
And the two dozen odious, bold, and melodious
</p>
<p class="i2">
Singers began to sing.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
The King in surprise said: "Dozens of pies
</p>
<p class="i2">
In the course of our life we've tried,
</p>
<p>
But never before us was served up a chorus
</p>
<p class="i2">
Like this that we hear inside!"
</p>
<p>
With a thunderous look he ordered the cook
</p>
<p class="i2">
And the steward before him brought,
</p>
<p>
And with a beatified smile: "He is satisfied!"
</p>
<p class="i2">
Both of these innocents thought.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
"Of sinners the worst," said Karl the First,
</p>
<p class="i2">
"Is the barbarous ruffian that
</p>
<p>
A song-bird would slaughter, unless for his daughter
</p>
<p class="i2">
Or wife he is trimming a hat.
</p>
<p>
We'll punish you so for the future you'll know
</p>
<p class="i2">
That from mercy you can't depart.
</p>
<p>
Observe that your lenient, kind, intervenient
</p>
<p class="i2">
King has a tender heart!"

<p>
He saw that the cook in a neighboring brook
</p>
<p class="i2">
Was drowned (as he quite deserved),
</p>
<p>
And he ordered the steward at once to be skewered.
</p>
<p class="i2">
(The steward was much unnerved.)
</p>
<p>
"It's a curious thing," said the merciful King,
</p>
<p class="i2">
"That monarchs so tender are,
</p>
<p>
So oft we're affected that we have suspected that
</p>
<p class="i2">
We are too kind by far."

To note that the quality's sometimes strained.

THE UNUSUAL UBIQUITY

<br />
<span class="s05">
OF

<br />

THE INQUISITIVE GANDER

</h2>
<hr class="l15">


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
A gander dwelt upon a farm
</p>
<p class="i2">
And no one could resist him,
</p>
<p>
For had he died, such was his charm,
</p>
<p class="i2">
His neighbors would have missed him:
</p>
<p>
His scorn for any loud display,
</p>
<p>
His cheerful hissing day by day,
</p>
<p>
Would win your heart in such a way
</p>
<p class="i2">
You almost could have kissed him.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
This bird was always nosing 'round.
</p>
<p class="i2">
Most patiently he waited
</p>
<p>
Until an open door he found,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And then investigated.
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112'>112</a></span>
</p>
<p>
He loved to poke, he loved to peek,
</p>
<p>
In every knothole, so to speak,
</p>
<p>
He quickly thrust his prying beak,
</p>
<p class="i2">
For what was hid he hated.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
The farm exhausted: "Now," said he:
</p>
<p class="i2">
"My policy's expansion.
</p>
<p>
When one's convinced how things should be
</p>
<p class="i2">
The proper course he can't shun.
</p>
<p>
His mind made up, he followed it,
</p>
<p>
Relying on his native wit,
</p>
<p>
And soon had wandered, bit by bit,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Through all his master's mansion.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
"At least," he said: "It's not my fault
</p>
<p class="i2">
If everything's not seen to:
</p>
<p>
I've gone from garret down to vault,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And glanced into the lean-to.
</p>
<p>
In every room I've chanced to stop;
</p>
<p>
A supervising glance to drop,
</p>
<p>
I've looked below, I've looked on top,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Behind, and in between, too!"
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113'>113</a></span>
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
One thing alone he found to blame,
</p>
<p class="i2">
As thus his time he squandered,
</p>
<p>
For, seeing not the farmer's dame,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Into her room he wandered,
</p>
<p>
And mounting nimbly on the bed:
</p>
<p>
"Why, bless my careful soul!" he said:
</p>
<p>
"These pillows are as hard as lead.
</p>
<p class="i2">
Now, how comes that?" he pondered.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
The farmer's dame for half an hour
</p>
<p class="i2">
Had watched the bird meander,
</p>
<p>
And finding him within her power,
</p>
<p class="i2">
She leaped upon the gander.
</p>
<p>
"Why, how de do, my gander coy?"
</p>
<p>
She shouted: "What will be my joy
</p>
<p>
To dream to-night on you, my boy!"
</p>
<p class="i2">
(This was no baseless slander.)
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
For with a stoutish piece of string
</p>
<p class="i2">
Securely was this fool tied,
</p>
<p>
And by a leg and by a wing
</p>
<p class="i2">
Unto an oaken stool tied:
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114'>114</a></span>
</p>
<p>
While, pinning towels around her gown,
</p>
<p>
She plucked him with relentless frown,
</p>
<p>
And stuffed the pillows with his down,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And roasted him for Yuletide.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
<span class="smcap">The moral</span> is: When you explore

<p class="i2">
Don't try to be superior:
</p>
<p>
Be cautious, and retire before
</p>
<p class="i2">
Your safety grows inferior.
</p>
<p>
'Tis best to stay upon the coast,
</p>
<p>
Or some day you will be like most
</p>
<p>
Of all that bold exploring host
</p>
<p class="i2">
That's gone to the interior.
